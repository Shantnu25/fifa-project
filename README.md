# FIFA Project

You are a data scientist who wishes to make it big by becoming a football club manager.
A rich club has decided to hire you as their manager. You have all the money to build a team from scratch.

Your aim is to find out the best squad for the upcoming football championship. 

# About the Dataset    

# Evaluation metrics

For this particular dataset, we are using r2 score as the evaluation metric. 

r2_score (coefficient of determination) regression score function.

Best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features, would get a score of 0.0.

# Outcomes

In this project, I applied the following concepts:

    Train-test split
    Correlation between the features
    Linear Regression
    MSE and R2_score Evaluation Metric
